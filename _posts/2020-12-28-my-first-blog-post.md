I am a dreamer
My imagination can see
All the possibilities 
That life could be

Thoughts are addictive
They’ve a mind of their own
And I let them take me
To destinations unknown

Through dense jungles of my mind
To depths of my ocean floor
Climb my highest mountains
So many places to explore

There are responsibilities 
Which like to drag me down
Back to the sea of reality
Where I’m afraid I'll drown

But then I imagine to sail away
Somewhere I cannot be found
Cause I like to be free 
In worlds I'm not bound
